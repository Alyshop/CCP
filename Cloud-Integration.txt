Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service 

Queue = FILA!

Amazon SQS - Standard Queue 

- Oldest AWS offering (over 10 years old)
- Fully managed service (serverless), use to decouple applications 
- Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000s per second 
- Default retention of messages: 4 days, maximum of 14 days
- No limit to how many messages can be in the queue 
- Messages are deleted after they're read by consumers 
- Low latency (<10ms on publish and receive)
- Consumers share the work to read messages & scale horizontally
- SQS to decouple between applications tier 



Amazon Kinesis 

- For the exam: Kinesis = real-time big data streaming 
- Managed service to collect, process and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale 
- Too detaild for the Cloud Practitioner exam but good to know:
    - Kinesis Data Streams: low latency straming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
    - Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc...
    - Kinesis Data Analytics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL 
    - Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML 


Amazon SNS - Simples Notification Service

- The "event publishers" only sends message to one SNS topic 
- As many "event subscribers" as we want to listen to the SNS topic Notifications
- Each subscribers to the topic will get all the messages 
- Up to 12,500,000 subscriptions per topic, 100,00 topics limit

       pubilish          queue/emails/lambda etc...
SNS -------------> SQS -----------> 




Amazon MQ 

- SQS, SNS are "cloud-native" services: proprietary protocols from AWS 
- Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, OPENWIRE, WSS
- When Migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ 
- Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for " Rabbit MQ , ACTIVE MQ "



- Amazon MQ doesn't "scale" as musch as SQS / SNS 
- Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover 
- Amazon MQ has both queue feature (SQS) and topic features (SNS)
