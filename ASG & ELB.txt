ASG = Auto Scaling Group
ELB = Elastic Load Balancing


*Scalability & High Availability*

- Scalability means t hat an apllication / system can handle greater loads by adapting
- The are two kinds of scalability:
    - Vertical Scalability
    - Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability



*Vertical Scalability*

- Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
- Scaling that apllication vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database. 
- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

*Horizontal Scalability*

- Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
- Horizontal scaling imples distributed systems. 
- This very common for web application / mordern application
- It's easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2


*High Availability*



*WHY USE A LOAD BALANCER?*

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of acess (DNS) to yout apllication
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to yout instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- High availability across zones
- An ELB is a maged load balancer
    - AWS guarateens that it will be working
    - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
    - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It cost less to setup yout own load balancer but it will be a lot more offert on your end 
- 4 kind of load balancers offered by AWS:
    - Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only) - Layer 7
    - Network Load Balancer (ultra-hihg perfomance, allows for TCP) - Layer 4
    - Gateway Load Balancer - Layer 3
    - Classic Load Balancer (retired) - Layer 4 & 7   -> Application Load Balancer <- novo Classic Load Balancer



What's an Auto Scaling Group?

-In real-life, the load on yout websites and application can change
- In the cloud, you can create and get rid of servers very quickly
- The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to: 
    - Scale out (add EC2 instances) to match an increased load
    - Scale in (remove EC2 instances) to match a decreased load
    - Automatically register new instances to a load balancer
    - Replace unhealthy instances
- Cost Savings: only run at an optimal capacity (principle of the cloud)


Auto Scaling Groups - Scaling Strategies 

- Manual Scaling: Update the size of an ASG manually
- Dynamic Scaling: Respond to changing demand
    - Simple / Step Scaling
        - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
        - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (example CPU < 30%), then remove 1
    - Target Tracking Scaling
        - Example: I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
    - Scheduled Scaling
        - Anticipate a scaling based on known usage patterns
        - Example: increase the min. capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays


ELB & ASG - Summary

- High Availability vs Scalability (vertical and Horizontal) vs elasticity vs Agility in the Cloud
- Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
    - Distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be Multi-AZ
    - Supports health checks
    - 4 types: Classic (old), Application (HTTP - L7), Network (TCP - L4), Gateway (L3)

- Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
    - Implement elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
    - Scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy 
    - Integrated with the ELB
