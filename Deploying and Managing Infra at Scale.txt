What is CloudFormation

- CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported)
- Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that yout specify

- Infrastructure as code 
    
    - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control 
    - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code 

- Cost 

    - Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack cost you
    - You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template
