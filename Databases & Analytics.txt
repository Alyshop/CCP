Databases Intro 

- Storing data on disk (EFS,EBS,EC2 Instance Store, S3) can have it limits
- Sometimes, you want to store data in a database 
- You can structure the data
- You build indexes to efficiently query / search through the data 
- You define relationships between your datasets 

- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints


Relational Databases

- Looks just like Excel spreadsheets, with links between them! 
- Can use the SQL language to perfom quieries / lookups

NoSQL Data Bases 

- NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational database
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications 
- Benefits
    - Flexibility: easy to evolve data model
    - Scalability: designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters 
    - High-perfomance: optimized for a specific data model 
    - Highly functional: types optimized for the data model 

Examples: Key-valeu, document, graph, in-memory, search databases





AWS RDS - Overview 

- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS 
    - Postgres
    - MySQL 
    - MariaDB
    - Oracle 
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - Aurora (AWS Propietary database)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

- RDS is a managed service:
    - Automated provisioning, OS patching
    - Continuos backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
    - Monitoring dashborads
    - Read replicas for improved read performance
    - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
    - Maintenance windows for upgrades
    - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
    - Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
- BUT you can't SSH into your instances


Amazon Aurora 

- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- PostgreSQL and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB 
- Aurora is "AWS cloud optimized" and claims 5x perfomance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the perfomance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora Storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 128TB 
- Aurora cost more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient 
- Not in the free tier 


RDS deployments: Read Replicas, Multi-AZ 

- Read Replicas:
    - Scale the read workload of your DB
    - Can create up to 5 Read Replicas 
    - Data is only writter on the main DB

- Multi-AZ 
    - Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
    - Data is only read/writter to the main database 
    - Can only have 1 other AZ as failover 

RDS deployments: Multi-Region 

- Multi-Regions (Read Replicas)
    - Disaster Recovery in case of region issue 
    - Local perfomance for global reads 
    - Replication cost 


Amazon ElastiCache Overview 

- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases... 
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached 
- Caches are in-memory databases with high perfomance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads 

- AWS takes care of OS Maintenance / Patching, Optimizations, Setups, Configuration, Monitoring, Failure Recovery and Backups 



DynamoDB

- Fully Managed Highly available with replication across 3 AZ 
- NoSQL database - not a relation database 
- Scales to massive workloads, distributed "serveless" database 
- Milions of requests per seconds, trillions of row, 100s os TB of storage 
- Fast and consistent in perfomance 
- Single-digit millisecond latency - low latency retrieval 
- Integrated with IAM for security, authorization and administration 
- Low cost and auto scaling capabilities 
- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class 

DynamoDB Accelerator - DAX 

- Fully Managed in-memory cache for DynamoDB
- 10x perfomance improvement - sigle-digit millisecond latency to microseconds latency - when accessing your DynamoDB tables 
- Secure, Highly Scalable & Highly available
- Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP level: DAX is only used for and is integrated with DynamoDB, while ElastiCache can be used for other databases 


DynamoDB - Global Tables 

- Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
- Active-Active replication (read/write t o any AWS Region)




Redshift Overview 

- Redshift is based on PostgreSQL, but its not used for OLTP 
- OLTP = ONLINE TRANSITION PROCESSING / processamento de transacoes online (analystcs and data warehousing)
- Load data once every hour, not every second 
- 10x better perefomance than other data warehouses, scale to PBs of data
- Columnar storage of data (instead of row based)
- Massively Parallel Query Execution (MPP), Highly available
- Pay as you go based on the instances provisioned 
- Has a SQL interface for perfmoing the quieries 
- BI tools such as AWS Quicksight or Tableau integrate with it 


Amazon EMR 

- EMR stands for "Elastic MapReduce" 
- EMR helps creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vas amount of data
- The clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances 
- Also supports Apache Spark, Hbase, Presto, Flink...
- EMR takes care of all the provisioning and configuration
- Auto-scaling and integrated with Spot instances 
- Use cases: data processing, machine learnign, web indexing, big data... 



Amazon Athena 

- Serveless query service to perfom analytics agains S3 objects 
- Uses standard SQL language to query files 
- Supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, And Parquet (built on presto)

- Pricing: $5.00 per TB of data scanned 
- Use compressed or columnar data for cost-saving (less scan)
