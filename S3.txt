S3 = Simple Storage Service

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS 
- It's advertised as "Infinitely scaling" Storage

- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone = (é a parte mais importante de um sistema que fornece o suporte central para que múltiplas redes se conectem e conversem umas com as outras. )
- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well 

- We'll have a step-by-step approach to S3


Amazon S3 Use cases

- Backup and Storage
- Disaster Recovery 
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud Storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting 
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static websites



Amazon S3 - Buckets 

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level 
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region 
- Naming convertion
    - No uppercase, No underscore
    - 3-63 characters long
    - Not an IP 
    - Must start with lowecase letter or number
    - Must NOT start with the prefix xn--
    - Must NOT end with the suffix -s3alias


Amazon S3 - Objects

- Objects (files) have a key
- The key is thge FULL path: 
    - s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
    - s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
The key is composed of prefix + object name
    s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
-There's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- Just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")

Amazon S3 - Objects (cont.)

- Object values are the content of the body.
    - Max. Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
    - If uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload" 
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
