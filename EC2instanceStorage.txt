*EBS & EFS*


What's an EBS Volume?
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
- It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
- They are bound to a specific availability zone

- Analogy: Think of them as a "network USB stick"
- Free tier: 30GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per month

- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
    - An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
    - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it

- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)


*EBS Snapshot*
- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not a necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

- Para transferir os dados de uma EC2(US-EAST-1A) para outra EC2(US-EAST-1B) em outra regiao, e possivel por meio de um SNAPSHOT em AZ.

- EBS Snapshot Archive
    - Move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
    - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive

- Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots
    - Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
    - Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year)



*AMI Overview*
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
    - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
    - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged 
- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instances from:
    - A Public AMI: AWS provided
    - Your OWN AMI: you make and maintain them yourself
    - An AWS marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)



*EC2 Image Builder*
- Used to automate the creation of Virtual Machines or Container images
- Automate the creation, maintain, validate and teste EC2 AMIs
- Can be run on a schedule
- Free service (only pay for the underlying resources)\


*EFS - Elastic File System*
- Managed NSF (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
- EFS works with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ



*EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA)*
- Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
- Up to 92% lower cost compared to EFS Standard
- EFS will automatically move your files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed
- Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
- Example: move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA


Modelo de Responsabilidade compartilhada para EC2 Storage

*AWS*
- Infrastructure
- Replication for data for EBS volumes & EFS drives
- Replicing faulty hardware
- Ensuring their employees cannot access your data

*Customer*
- Setting up backup / snapshot procedures
- Setting up data encryption
- Responsibility of any data on the drivers 
- Understanding the risk of using EC2 Instance Store


EC2 Instance Storage - Summary

- EBS volumes:
    - network drives attached to one EC2 instance at a time
    - Mapped to an AZ
    - Can use EBS Snapshots for backups / transfering EBS volumes across AZ

AMI - create ready-to-use EC2 instances with our customizations 

EC2 Image Builder - automatically build, teste and distribute AMIs

EC2 Instance Store:
    - High perfomamnce hardware disk attached to our EC2 instance
    - Lost if uor instance is stopped / terminated

EFS - network file system, can be attached to 100s of instances in a region

EFS-IA - cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files

FSx for Windows: Network file System for Windows servers 

FSx for Lustre: High perfomamnce computing Linux file sistem
